# newshiny-airquality

This is a simple Shiny web application that visualizes Ozone levels from the airquality dataset using a histogram. The app allows users to adjust the number of bins used in the histogram to explore the distribution of Ozone levels in the dataset.

Features
Dynamic Histogram: The app creates a histogram of Ozone levels from the airquality dataset.
Adjustable Bins: Users can control the number of bins (or intervals) used in the histogram via a slider input, dynamically changing the granularity of the plot.

How to Use
Launch the App: Run the Shiny app locally or deploy it on a Shiny server.
Adjust Bins: Use the slider on the sidebar to adjust the number of bins used in the histogram. The number of bins determines how the Ozone data is grouped into ranges.
View Results: The histogram will update in real-time as you adjust the number of bins, showing different levels of detail in the Ozone level distribution.
What are "bins" in a histogram?
In this app, the bins represent how the range of Ozone levels is divided into equal intervals. Each bin corresponds to a bar in the histogram, showing how many data points fall within that interval.

Fewer bins (e.g., 10): The histogram will show a rougher overview with wider intervals.
More bins (e.g., 50): The histogram will display more bars with narrower intervals, providing more detailed insights into the data distribution.
